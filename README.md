**grok-cli** is an alternative online installer for xAI’s `grok` CLI. The official one-liner on [x.ai](https://x.ai) (`curl -fsSL https://x.ai/cli/install.sh | bash`) is built for macOS, Linux, and Windows. It is **not** intended for Termux or other “this login only” phones. This program fetches the **same** vendor `grok` binary from xAI’s CLI channel and places it under `~/.grok` — it does **not** download or run `install.sh`.

### Why grok-cli is a better alternative

x.ai’s installer is the right path on a laptop. On a phone (and on any host that installer does not cover) it typically fails in ways that look like a broken download: wrong CPU if you `scp` grok from an x86_64 PC onto aarch64 Termux; Android’s linker refuses the static Linux file (`unexpected e_type: 2`); Termux has no `nameserver` in `/etc/resolv.conf` so `grok login` hits a DNS error; after a correct install, `grok -p hello` prints the answer and then **hangs until Ctrl-Z**.

This program is a better alternative **there** because it is written for that host instead of hoping `install.sh` will cope:

| Official `install.sh` | grok-cli |
|-----------------------|----------|
| One-liner assumes macOS / Linux / Windows | POSIX `/bin/sh` (does **not** need bash); Termux `PREFIX` / `pkg` as this login |
| Places whatever the script assumes | `setup` fetches the matching `linux-aarch64` / `linux-x86_64` (or Darwin) artifact and **smokes `--version` on this host** |
| No check that an x86_64 copy runs on a phone | Wrong ELF is **not** “already installed”; `--force` replaces it |
| Android `ET_EXEC` refusal looks like a truncated file | Retries `TERMUX_EXEC_OPTOUT`, may `pkg install -y proot` (no sudo), wraps grok **without editing vendor bytes** |
| musl grok reads `/etc/resolv.conf` with no nameserver | Binds `~/.grok/resolv.conf` over `/etc/resolv.conf` via PRoot |
| `grok -p` hangs: leftover Termux `runsvdir` keep PRoot in `do_wait` | From **1.8.22**: bind a no-op over `start-services.sh` so login-shell env capture does not spawn those daemons; reaper as safety net so `-p` returns |
| Login truth is “the file is there” | `check-session` / the numbered list run live `grok -p hello` |

It is **not** a second grok program and **not** official x.ai Termux support. After `setup`, open a new terminal if `grok` is not on this session’s PATH, then `grok login` (or set `XAI_API_KEY`). Sharing `~/.grok/auth.*` across logins on one host is optional later work (`backup` / `sync-auth`), not the reason this tool exists.

| You | Official x.ai installer | Not this |
|-----|-------------------------|----------|
| Install grok-cli, then `grok-cli setup` (no sudo) | `curl -fsSL https://x.ai/cli/install.sh \| bash` on macOS / Linux / Windows | A second grok binary; executing x.ai’s `install.sh`; claiming official Termux support |

## Features

- **Install grok without x.ai’s `install.sh`**: type `grok-cli setup`. It detects this computer, downloads the matching grok program from xAI, checks that `--version` runs from `~/.grok/downloads` (not `/tmp` or the cache folder — some phones refuse to run files from there), and places `~/.grok/bin/grok`. Skip if grok already **runs on this host**. An x86_64 file copied onto an aarch64 phone is replaced. On Termux, if the phone will not run the vendor file, setup may install `proot` with `pkg` (this login, no sudo) and place a wrapper — it still does **not** edit the vendor file. `--force` downloads again. POSIX `/bin/sh` (does **not** need bash).
- **Termux-aware place**: uses `${PREFIX}/bin` when `PREFIX` is set. A missing `/etc/resolv.conf` is a note, not an install failure, when `--version` succeeded. If grok still will not run: `pkg install proot`, then `grok-cli setup --force`. From **1.8.22** the PRoot wrapper stops leftover `runsvdir` from freezing `grok -p` (see **Platform Compatibility**).
- **Install this program**: paste the curl one-liner; later `version-check`, `self-update`, `self-uninstall`
- **Install from a checkout**: `install`, `uninstall`, `where-is-me`, `version`, `about`, `help`, `menu`
- **Start grok without auto-update**: type `grok-cli run` (or `grok-cli run -p hello`). On Termux this avoids the hang until Ctrl-Z. Missing grok → `grok-cli setup`.
- **Prove grok is logged in**: `check-session` asks grok a one-line question (`grok -p hello`). A credential file that only *looks* valid is not enough. Missing grok → `grok-cli setup`, then `grok login`.
- **Optional shared login on one Linux host**: `backup` copies `~/.grok/auth.*` into `/var/grok-cli` as `root:root` `0644` (elevated probe uses **this** login’s grok home, not root’s); `sync-auth` copies that store into this login’s `~/.grok` with **no sudo** (skipped if grok is already logged in — prints `No sync-auth for logged-in environment.`); `sync-auth-from-remote` uses `scp` (same skip) and remembers the last remote; `add-crontab` adds this login’s timers after **this** login’s backup grant exists
- **Optional passwordless backup grant** (only if you use `backup`): `print-sudoers` prints one line so this login may run `sudo grok-cli backup` without a password. A host admin installs that line. `generate-sudoer-request` / `submit-sudoer-request` hand the same grant to the named approver (`sudoer-adm`).
- **Stops when it should**: grok missing or not answering, unauthorized copy into `/var/grok-cli`, unreadable store, failed grok download

## Quick Installation

**Official grok installer** (macOS / Linux / Windows; not intended for Termux):

```sh
curl -fsSL https://x.ai/cli/install.sh | bash
```

**This project** (POSIX `/bin/sh`; Termux-friendly procedure — still the vendor `grok` binary):

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudgen/grok-cli/main/src/grok-cli | sh
grok-cli setup
```

Then open a **new terminal** if this session cannot find `grok`, and run `grok login`.

On **Termux (aarch64)** run `grok-cli setup` **on the phone**. `scp` of `~/.grok/bin/grok` from an x86_64 host copies `linux-x86_64` and Termux will reject it (`EM_X86_64` instead of `EM_AARCH64`). `setup` fetches `linux-aarch64` from x.ai; `--force` replaces a copied x86_64 file. If `--version` fails with `unexpected e_type: 2`, setup tries `pkg install -y proot` on Termux and wraps grok. If that still cannot run: `pkg install proot`, then `grok-cli setup --force`.

**Global grok-cli (root):**

```sh
sudo curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudgen/grok-cli/main/src/grok-cli | sudo sh
```

**Integrity (automatic, no env pin):** SHA-256. The program fetches the companion `${SCRIPT_URL}.sha256` itself and prints **link**, **value**, and **result**.

| Result | What happens |
|--------|----------------|
| Match | Install continues |
| Mismatch | Abort (non-zero) |
| Missing sidecar | Warn and continue |

Companion file in-repo: `src/grok-cli.sha256`  
Companion URL: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudgen/grok-cli/main/src/grok-cli.sha256`

**From a checkout (offline copy of grok-cli, no network):**

```sh
sh src/grok-cli install
# or force refresh after updates
sh src/grok-cli install --force

# Ensure ~/.local/bin is on PATH, then:
grok-cli version
grok-cli setup
```

**Global grok-cli from checkout** (preferred before durable sudoers / production elevation):

```sh
sudo sh src/grok-cli install
# or: grok-cli install --global   # needs write access to /usr/local/bin
# Managed binary mode is always 0755 so every user can run the shell ship unit.
```

**Optional — sudoers** (only if a non-root login will deposit into root-owned `/var/grok-cli`):

```sh
grok-cli print-sudoers-install-script
# Admin (account with sudo rights) — handoff script (path printed by CLI):
sudo sh /dev/shm/grok-cli-<user>-sudoers-admin.sh install

# Or JSON grant for sudoer-adm:
grok-cli generate-sudoer-request
grok-cli submit-sudoer-request
```

Local `~/.local/bin` install is **not** production-secure for host elevation — the user can change the binary. Prefer global install for any host that keeps `/etc/sudoers.d/grok-cli-<user>`. See [`SECURITY.md`](./SECURITY.md).

This product is **dual-mode**: primary install is the curl one-liner; `sh src/grok-cli install` copies the running checkout.

**Source repository:** [cloudgen/grok-cli](https://github.com/cloudgen/grok-cli)  
Config identity: `REPO_USER=cloudgen`, `REPO_NAME=grok-cli`. Default channel: `SCRIPT_URL=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudgen/grok-cli/main/src/grok-cli`.

After install, on a terminal:

```text
$ grok-cli menu
[INFO] **grok-cli**(*1.8.23*) — Alternative online installer for xAI grok
logged out
1. backup: *Push ~/.grok/auth.* to /var/grok-cli*
2. sync-auth: *Copy /var/grok-cli/auth.* into ~/.grok*
3. sync-auth-from-remote: *Copy a remote host's auth.* into ~/.grok*
4. add-crontab: *Add backup and sync-auth jobs to this login's crontab*
5. sudoers: *Grant and drafts*
9. Exit
```

On Termux / Git Bash / Windows cmd, **backup**, **sync-auth**, and **sudoers** are omitted. The line under **logged in** / **logged out** says those features are not available on that host. Remaining rows start at **1** with **run** (start grok without auto-update). When the session is **logged in**, **sync-auth** and **sync-auth-from-remote** are omitted on every host, and a second line is **appended**: `sync-auth and sync-auth-from-remote features are not available for logged-in environment.` That line does not replace the host line. Live capture on a multi-user host that is **logged in**:

```text
$ grok-cli menu
[INFO] **grok-cli**(*1.8.23*) — Alternative online installer for xAI grok
logged in
sync-auth and sync-auth-from-remote features are not available for logged-in environment.
1. backup: *Push ~/.grok/auth.* to /var/grok-cli*
2. add-crontab: *Add backup and sync-auth jobs to this login's crontab*
3. sudoers: *Grant and drafts*
9. Exit
```

Choose a number, or type the command name. `9` exits. The line under the title is **logged in** or **logged out** from a live `grok -p hello` (not from reading `auth.json` alone). On a real terminal the descriptions after the colon are gray and italic. `setup` is not on this list — type `grok-cli setup`. A later `sync-auth-from-remote` remembers the last remote in persistence and offers it as the prompt default.

## Usage

| How you run it | What you get |
|----------------|--------------|
| `grok-cli` or `grok-cli --debug` at a real terminal | Numbered start list (`backup` is **1** on a multi-user host when logged out; **logged in** / **logged out** under the title from `grok -p hello`; Termux / Git Bash / Windows cmd hide backup / sync-auth / sudoers; logged-in session hides sync-auth / sync-auth-from-remote and appends a not-available line; **9** leaves). Same as `grok-cli menu`. Overlay switches with no command still follow empty argv. |
| `curl -fsSL … \| sh` or `grok-cli` in a script (no args) | Install-ensure: places `~/.local/bin/grok-cli` or reports already installed. **Not** help. **Not** the menu. |
| `grok-cli help` or `grok-cli --json` (no command) | Help / JSON help. `--json` with no command is empty argv **special case**: JSON help even at a prompt |
| `grok-cli menu` in a script | Help (the list is TTY-only) |

```sh
grok-cli                 # numbered list on a real terminal; install-ensure in a script / pipe
grok-cli help
grok-cli menu            # same numbered list as empty argv on a TTY
grok-cli about
grok-cli --json about
grok-cli version-check
grok-cli self-update

grok-cli setup                 # install grok from x.ai (not grok-cli; not install.sh)
grok-cli run                   # start grok without auto-update (Termux)
grok-cli run -p hello
grok-cli check-session
grok-cli backup
grok-cli sync-auth
grok-cli sync-auth-from-remote user@192.0.2.10
grok-cli add-crontab

grok-cli print-sudoers
grok-cli generate-sudoer-request
grok-cli submit-sudoer-request
grok-cli uninstall --force
grok-cli self-uninstall --force
```

**Environment (selected):**

| Variable | Role |
|----------|------|
| `SCRIPT_URL` | grok-cli install channel (default github raw `src/grok-cli`) |
| `GROK_HOME` | Grok auth directory (default `~/.grok` of the invoking login) |
| `GROK_VENDOR_BASE_URL` | xAI grok channel/artifact base (default `https://x.ai/cli`) |
| `GROK_CHANNEL` | grok channel (`stable` / `alpha` / `enterprise`; default `stable`) |
| `GROK_BIN` | Override path to peer `grok` |
| `GROK_PROMPT_TIMEOUT` | Seconds to wait for `grok -p hello` (default 20; always bounded) |
| `DEBUG` | `1` or flag `--debug`: stderr diagnostics; numbered menu prints elapsed of each paint step |
| `GROK_PROMPT_KILL_AFTER` | SIGKILL grace after that deadline (default 2; GNU `timeout -k`) |
| `GROK_CLI_ROOT` | Durable auth store (default `/var/grok-cli`; optional sharing) |
| `ALLOW_TEST_LOCAL_SUDOERS` | `1` = allow test-mode sudoers emit without `--allow-test-local` |
| `SUDOER_CLI` | Override path to `sudoer-cli` |
| `SUDOER_ADM_USER` | Approver login to detect (default `sudoer-adm`) |

## Examples

```sh
# Place xAI grok (skip if already installed)
grok-cli setup
# open a new terminal if grok is not on this session PATH yet
grok-cli run                   # Termux: start grok without auto-update
# or: grok login

# Optional: confirm grok actually answers, then share auth.* on this host
grok-cli check-session    # runs grok -p hello first
grok-cli backup

# Another login on the same host, no sudo:
grok-cli sync-auth

# Pull the shared store from another host (openssh scp; no sudo):
grok-cli sync-auth-from-remote user@192.0.2.10

# After sudoer-adm approves THIS login's backup grant:
grok-cli add-crontab
```

## Platform Compatibility

| Platform | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Linux, `/bin/sh` (dash/bash) | Supported |
| Termux / Android userspace | Supported for **this installer** (`setup` smokes under `~/.grok/downloads`, honors `$PREFIX/bin`, does not require bash). Vendor `linux-aarch64` grok is often `ET_EXEC`; setup retries `TERMUX_EXEC_OPTOUT`, may `pkg install -y proot`, and may place a wrapper without patching the file. Missing `/etc/resolv.conf` is not an install failure — use `XAI_API_KEY` or a host with working DNS if login fails. **Not** official x.ai Termux support. Why `grok -p` can hang until Ctrl-Z: **Why grok under PRoot does not return to the shell** below. |
| `python3` (optional) | Used for leftover `auth.json` shape helper when present (session gate is `grok -p hello`) |
| `sudo` + narrow sudoers | Required only for non-root `backup` into `/var/grok-cli` |
| macOS | `setup` follows xAI’s Darwin/arch detect; GNU `date -d` / `stat -c` assumptions may differ for other verbs |
| Windows | Out of scope (fail closed in `setup`) |

### Why grok under PRoot does not return to the shell

**In one sentence:** on Termux, xAI’s `grok` often cannot run as a normal phone program, so `setup` starts it through **PRoot**; grok already printed and exited, but leftover Termux `runsvdir` (started by login-shell env capture) keep PRoot waiting — your shell looks frozen until **Ctrl-Z**.

| Box | Meaning | Example |
|-----|---------|---------|
| You / this login | Type `grok -p hello` on Termux and expect the prompt back | `Hello. How can I help you today?` then `~ $` |
| The other role | PRoot is a user-space trampoline (not real root, not a full Linux distro). It traces grok so a static Linux file can run on Android and can bind `~/.grok/resolv.conf` over `/etc/resolv.conf` | `pkg install proot` then `grok-cli setup` |
| Not this | grok-cli’s numbered list refusing to close; a corrupt `self-update`; byte-patching grok | Choice **9** already exits; SHA-256 passing does not prove `grok -p` returns |

| Includes | Excludes |
|----------|----------|
| What PRoot is; why grok-cli uses it; the causal chain of the `-p` hang; why Ctrl-C fails and Ctrl-Z works; what **1.8.22** does | Claiming official x.ai Termux support; editing vendor grok bytes; treating PRoot as `sudo` or as `proot-distro` |

**What PRoot is.** PRoot (Ptrace ROOT) rewrites grok’s system calls with `ptrace`. It does **not** give you root. grok-cli uses it because the vendor `linux-aarch64` file is a static Linux executable (`ET_EXEC`). Android’s linker refuses that file (`unexpected e_type: 2`). Termux’s `/etc/resolv.conf` also has no `nameserver`, so musl inside grok fails DNS unless PRoot binds a file that does. The wrapper unsets `LD_PRELOAD` (termux-exec would re-hit `e_type` 2) and runs `proot` plus the **unmodified** vendor file.

**Why `-p` does not exit.** Official grok `-p` is one-shot: print, then exit. On-device study (Termux aarch64, `proot` 5.1, `termux-services` + `runit`): `grok-linux` **does** `_exit` after the reply. `grok --help` under the **same** PRoot returns in ~0.3s — proof PRoot can exit when it has no leftover daemons. PRoot’s loop is `wait4(-1, …, __WALL)` (`wchan=do_wait`): it does not return until **every remaining tracee is dead**, including processes that later daemonize and reparent to PID 1. There is **no** `proot -r` rootfs; PRoot is only a syscall translator.

The leftover processes are **not** grok helpers. During session init, grok starts **two login shells** to snapshot the user environment (`bash -lc 'source "$HOME/.bashrc"; …'`). Termux login shells source `$PREFIX/etc/profile`, which sources `profile.d/start-services.sh`, which runs `(service-daemon start &)` → `start-stop-daemon -S -b … runsvdir $SVDIR`. `-b` double-forks. On a normal Termux login that is what you want. **Under PRoot it is fatal:** the new `runsvdir` remains a tracee and lives forever as a supervisor. Two login shells ⇒ two extra `runsvdir` per `grok -p`. They race `$PREFIX/var/run/service-daemon.pid` and usually cannot see Termux’s already-running `runsvdir`, so they start extras instead of no-op’ing.

**Causal chain**

```text
grok -p hello
  → wrapper execs proot (no rootfs) over grok-linux-aarch64
    → grok-linux starts two `bash -lc` env-capture processes
      → bash -l sources $PREFIX/etc/profile
        → profile.d/start-services.sh
          → (service-daemon start &)
            → start-stop-daemon -S -b … runsvdir $SVDIR
              → runsvdir double-forks, PPID=1, STILL a PRoot tracee
    → grok-linux prints the reply and _exit()s
    → proot wait4(-1, __WALL)    # leftover runsvdir still alive
      → grok -p never returns
```

Isolation (same PRoot flags as the wrapper: `proot -b ~/.grok/resolv.conf:/etc/resolv.conf <cmd>`):

| Command | Result |
|---------|--------|
| `grok -p hello` | Reply prints; hang until SIGKILL; two leftover `runsvdir` |
| `grok --help` | Exits in ~0.3s (no env-capture login shells) |
| `proot … bash -lc 'echo LOGIN_OK'` | Hang — **does not need grok at all** |
| `proot … bash -c 'echo NONLOGIN_OK'` | Exits at once |
| `proot … bash --noprofile --norc -lc '…'` | Exits at once |
| `env -u SVDIR grok -p hello` | Still hangs (`start-services.sh` re-exports `SVDIR`) |

Matching leftovers by `ps -o comm=` never fires on Termux (`comm` truncates to `/data/data/com.`). Match **args / exe paths**. Do **not** kill Termux’s own `runsvdir` (sshd / ssh-agent live there). Nested PRoot deadlocks (`ptrace_stop`); do not debug this hang by launching `grok -p` from an agent already under grok’s PRoot.

**Why Ctrl-C fails and Ctrl-Z works.** Ctrl-C is `SIGINT` — grok/PRoot often ignore it (or treat it as “cancel this turn”). Ctrl-Z is `SIGTSTP` — the shell’s job control, usually not caught — so you get `Stopped`. An old wrapper did `exec proot grok …`, so there was no parent left to SIGKILL.

**What grok-cli does (1.8.22).** The wrapper binds `/dev/null` over `$PREFIX/etc/profile.d/start-services.sh` so those login shells do not spawn extra `runsvdir` (it does **not** edit Termux’s file). It still passes `proot --kill-on-exit` (never `-k`) and `--no-auto-update` on `-p`, and keeps a **PRoot-exit reaper** as the safety net: when grok-linux is gone, kill only new `runsvdir`, then SIGKILL PRoot if needed. The menu probe uses that reaper when `proot` is on PATH, else simple `grok -p hello`. Interactive `grok` still `exec`s so the TUI owns the terminal. `grok-cli setup` rewrites a stale wrapper even when grok already runs (no `--force`). After `self-update` to **1.8.22**:

```sh
grok-cli setup
grok-cli run          # start grok without auto-update
grok-cli run -p hello # must return to ~ $ without Ctrl-Z
```

`grep proot-exit-reaper ~/.grok/bin/grok` should match. grok-cli’s own menu (Choice **9**) was already closable in **1.8.14**; that bound only the menu probe, not operator-facing `grok`. On Termux the numbered list starts with **run**.
