**file**: docs/requirements/requirement-shell-path-and-shell-support.md  
**Status**: Active (Version 1.0.0)  
**Area**: shell  
**Key**: `requirement-shell-path-and-shell-support`  
**Philosophy**: CIAO **v2.10.2** / CIAO-Lite (Caution • Intentional • Anti-fragile • Over-engineered / Over-protect)

## 1. Purpose

This file is the **topic-owner** for **shell-rc** edits on grok-cli: after a **user-bin** install, this login can run `grok-cli` by name, and an SSH login can reach that PATH.

It owns **path-ensure** (one shared `USER_BIN` line on interactive rc) and **profile-ensure** (create `~/.profile` if missing so a login shell sources `.bashrc`). It also owns **sibling unify** so another similar CLI does not, *by design*, make `.bashrc` non-compliant; **heal** on every user-bin `install` / channel ensure / `self-update` (including already-installed skip); **scoped uninstall**; and **detect** via a Type 0 `rc-test` (not a lock on the file).

**Scope:** Which rc files this product writes; the exact PATH line; create / append / no-op; profile create-if-absent; write-path env; sibling comments; uninstall of **this** product’s stickers; fixture tests; `rc-test`.  
**Out of scope (cited, not re-owned):** Placing or removing the binary (`requirement-shell-local-self-management` · `requirement-shell-online-install` · `requirement-shell-self-management`); peer grok vendor PATH block for `~/.grok/bin` (`requirement-grok-setup`); Termux host writing (`requirement-shell-termux-coding`); scratch/cache (`requirement-shell-cli-storage`).

**Not claimed:** login-review hook; Type 1 `setup` `chown` of another login’s rc; `/etc/environment`; crontab.

### 1.1 Human-facing

**In one sentence:** After `grok-cli install` (or the curl one-liner), this login’s desk note (`.bashrc`) gets “also look in `~/.local/bin`,” and if the door note (`.profile`) is missing the program hangs one that sources `.bashrc` — without wiping notes other programs already wrote.

| Box | Meaning | Example |
|-----|---------|---------|
| You / this login | The person who ran install | `grok-cli install` |
| The other role | Tests that point `BASHRC` at a throw-away folder | `grok-cli rc-test --root "$tmpdir" --file bashrc --case create` |
| Not this file | Copying the program into `~/.local/bin`; installing peer grok | `requirement-shell-local-self-management.md` · `requirement-grok-setup.md` |

| Includes | Excludes |
|----------|----------|
| One shared PATH line; create `.bashrc` if missing; create `.profile` if missing | Login-review scrap; dest JSON owner; `/etc` PATH; vendor `# >>> grok installer >>>` for `~/.grok/bin` |
| Keep other apps’ comments; heal PATH if a sibling deleted the line | Locking `.bashrc` so nobody else can write; replacing the whole file |

| Surface | What you open | What for |
|---------|---------------|----------|
| `grok-cli install` | Command | Companion writes PATH + profile |
| `grok-cli rc-test` | Test-purpose command | Create / modify / no-op against a temp folder |
| `grok-cli help` | Command | Environment lists `BASHRC`; testers listed **apart** from operational verbs |

| You do… | What it means | What you type |
|---------|---------------|---------------|
| Install for yourself | Program file goes in `USER_BIN`; PATH line is added once; missing `.profile` is created. A second install does not duplicate the PATH line. | `grok-cli install` |
| Prove PATH without touching this login’s real `.bashrc` | A temp folder is the scratch pad. Real home rc stays still. | `grok-cli rc-test --root "$tmpdir" --file bashrc --case create` |
| Remove this program while other tools remain in `~/.local/bin` | PATH line stays. Only this product’s installer comments may go. | `grok-cli uninstall --force` |

## 2. Core Rules / Requirements (Mandatory)

### 2.1 Catalog (claimed vs unused)

| Feature | This product | Files |
|---------|--------------|-------|
| **path-ensure** | **Claimed** | `.bashrc` (`BASHRC`): create if missing. `.zshrc` (`ZSHRC`): only if the file exists (do **not** invent it). Fish `config.fish` (`FISH_CONFIG`): create the config dir if needed. **Not** `.profile` |
| **profile-ensure** | **Claimed** | `.profile` (`PROFILE`): create if absent with a sample that sources `.bashrc`; **never overwrite** an existing body |
| **login-hook** | **Unused** | Do **not** plant a review scrap in `.bashrc` or `.profile`. Do **not** strip another product’s `# BEGIN … login hook` block |
| **rc-owner** | **This-login writer** | After create/modify, mode readable (`0644`). No Type 1 `setup` `chown` of another login’s home. Writer **is** this login |

| File | path-ensure | profile-ensure | login-hook | rc-owner |
|------|-------------|----------------|------------|----------|
| `.bashrc` | Yes (create) | — | **Unused** | This login |
| `.zshrc` | Yes if exists | — | Unused | This login |
| `.profile` | **No** PATH line | **Yes** | Unused | This login |
| Fish `config.fish` | Yes (create dir) | — | Unused | This login |

**MUST NOT** treat `~/.ssh-*` vault dirs as this family. **MUST NOT** write another user’s rc.

### 2.2 Shared identity (measure 1)

Several similar CLIs **MAY** write the same login’s `.bashrc`. They **MUST** share **one** PATH identity.

| MUST | MUST NOT |
|------|----------|
| Use the exact bash/zsh line `export PATH="<USER_BIN>:$PATH"` (`USER_BIN` default `${HOME}/.local/bin`) | A second dialect (`$HOME` vs the expanded path, extra quotes, a different prefix) that would miss the exact-line check |
| Fish: exact `set -gx PATH <USER_BIN> $PATH` | A second Fish dialect |
| If that exact PATH line already exists (this product or a sibling), **do not** append a second `export PATH=` | Duplicate the exact export |
| **MAY** append **only** `# Added by grok-cli installer (<VERSION>)` when the shared PATH line is already present and this product’s comment is absent | Rewrite `# Added by <other-app> installer …` or any other product’s comment |
| Match the **exact** export line, not a `USER_BIN` substring | Treat a comment or unrelated line that contains `USER_BIN` as already-good |

The PATH line is **shared**. Compliance is “`USER_BIN` is on PATH,” not “only grok-cli’s sticker is on the note.”

Peer grok’s `# >>> grok installer >>>` / `# <<< grok installer <<<` block for `~/.grok/bin` is a **second** directory. This file **MUST NOT** treat that block as the shared `USER_BIN` line. Owner: `requirement-grok-setup`.

### 2.3 Append, never replace (measure 2)

| MUST | MUST NOT |
|------|----------|
| Create `BASHRC` if missing (header with `grok-cli` / `VERSION`, then PATH) | `printf … >` an **existing** `.bashrc` / `.zshrc` / Fish config |
| Keep the prior body; append PATH if the exact line is absent | Truncate or rewrite the whole file to “ensure PATH” |
| Create `.profile` only when **absent** | Overwrite an existing `.profile` body (including one created by sshd-cli or another sibling) |
| No-op when this product’s `VERSION` comments **and** the exact export already match (file bytes unchanged) | Replace a dongle or user rc |

A sibling that “ensures PATH” by writing a fresh file is how the first app’s compliance dies. This product **MUST NOT** be that sibling. Today’s ship **MUST NOT** return because `.bashrc` is missing (Termux often has no file — **L-PATH-01**).

### 2.4 Scoped uninstall (measure 3)

PATH cleanup is `inst_self_uninstall_cleanup_path`. Dual mention: `requirement-shell-local-self-management` / `requirement-shell-self-management` (remove the binary) · this file (what may be edited in rc). Call after a **user-bin** remove (`uninstall` and `self-uninstall`).

| Situation | This product MAY remove | MUST NOT remove |
|-----------|-------------------------|-----------------|
| Other files still in `USER_BIN` | **Only** `# Added by grok-cli installer …` comments | The shared `export PATH=` line; other apps’ comments; `.profile`; vendor grok installer block; login-hook `BEGIN`/`END` scraps; unrelated user lines |
| `USER_BIN` empty or missing | This product’s comments **and** the shared PATH line | `.profile`; other apps’ comments; vendor grok installer block; login-hook scraps; unrelated user lines |

**MUST** match `# Added by grok-cli installer` (this `APP_NAME`) **always**.  
**MUST NOT** use `/# Added by .* installer/d` (that deletes sshd-cli / sudoer-cli / dns-cli stickers).  
**MUST NOT** delete `.profile`.  
**MUST NOT** delete `# >>> grok installer >>>` … `# <<< grok installer <<<`.  
Root/global uninstall **MUST NOT** edit this-login rc PATH (system `GLOBAL_BIN` is already on PATH).

There is **no** OS lock that stops a naive other program from rewriting `.bashrc`. This product **MUST** follow the table so *it* is not that program.

### 2.5 Heal on every user-bin ensure (measure 4)

`inst_ensure_companion` **MUST** run on user-bin success paths **including already-installed skip**:

| Call site | Owner of the call | This file owns |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------|
| Checkout `install` (place **and** already-installed no-op) | `requirement-shell-local-self-management` | What companion writes to rc |
| Channel place **and** Type O / `curl\|sh` already-installed skip | `requirement-shell-online-install` | same |
| `self-update` after place | `requirement-shell-self-management` | same (reuses channel place) |

What companion does to rc:

1. Missing `BASHRC` → create + PATH.  
2. Exact PATH line gone → append once (header comment + export).  
3. Exact PATH present, this product’s comment absent → **MAY** append only `# Added by grok-cli installer (<VERSION>)`.  
4. Exact PATH + this `VERSION` comments already match → no-op.  
5. Missing `.profile` → create source-bashrc sample. Existing `.profile` → leave the body.

User-bin install only. **MUST NOT** run path-ensure for a root/global place into `GLOBAL_BIN`.

Re-running `grok-cli install` (or the curl one-liner) **MUST** restore a missing exact PATH line without duplicating it. That is recovery after a bad sibling, not a file lock.

### 2.6 Detect, do not police (measure 5)

This product **MUST NOT** `chattr +i`, flock, or otherwise lock `.bashrc` against other writers. It **MUST** make non-compliance **visible** and **healable**.

| Detector | Role |
|----------|------|
| Type 0 **`rc-test`** | Test-purpose verb. Target = caller `--root` tmp/cache folder (or `mktemp -d`). **MUST NOT** write this login’s real `{{HOME}}/.bashrc`. Dual mention: `requirement-shell-cli-interface`. **MUST** be routed (not a named-only Gap). |
| Fixture suites | **TP-LC-20** create / **TP-LC-21** modify dongle / **TP-LC-22** VERSION+exact-PATH no-op with `BASHRC` in a random temp folder; real `{{HOME}}/.bashrc` untouched |
| `about` / `help` | Help Environment lists `BASHRC`. `about` **MUST NOT** claim rc is healthy without a check. `about` **MAY** report whether the exact PATH line is present |

**`rc-test` argv (normative sample):**

```text
grok-cli rc-test --root "$tmpdir" --file bashrc --case create
grok-cli rc-test --root "$tmpdir" --file bashrc --case modify
grok-cli rc-test --root "$tmpdir" --file bashrc --case noop
grok-cli rc-test --root "$tmpdir" --file profile --case create
```

| Flag | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `--root` | Fixture directory (tmp/cache). Keep real `HOME`. |
| `--file` | `bashrc` \| `zshrc` \| `profile` (Fish when claimed) |
| `--case` | `create` \| `modify` \| `noop` |
| `--feature` | Optional: `path-ensure` \| `profile-ensure` (default from `--file`) |

**MUST:** invoke the same `path_add_*` / `path_ensure_profile` helpers production uses; assert real home rc untouched; no `sudo` except wrapping chmod/chown of **that** folder (this product: skip sudo — this login owns the fixture).  
**MUST NOT:** call `install` / dest / `setup` as part of `rc-test`; set `HOME=/tmp/…` to “isolate.”  
Help **MUST** list `rc-test` under a heading **apart** from operational verbs (install, setup, …).

### 2.7 Write-path env

| Variable | Default | Tests |
|----------|---------|-------|
| `BASHRC` | `${HOME}/.bashrc` | Fixture file; **MUST** honor a non-empty override |
| `ZSHRC` | `${HOME}/.zshrc` | Fixture; honor override when zsh PATH is claimed |
| `FISH_CONFIG` | `${HOME}/.config/fish/config.fish` | Fixture; honor override when Fish PATH is claimed |
| `PROFILE` | `${HOME}/.profile` | Fixture; honor override when profile-ensure is claimed |

**MUST NOT** ignore a non-empty `BASHRC` (always write `${HOME}/.bashrc` instead). Same for `ZSHRC` / `FISH_CONFIG` / `PROFILE` when those helpers run.

Helpers: `path_add_shell` (orchestrator), `path_add_bashrc`, `path_add_zshrc`, `path_add_fish`, `path_ensure_profile`, `path_rc_test`. Prefix ownership: `requirement-shell-modular-function-design`.

### 2.8 Implementation Notes (this project)

| Item | Value for grok-cli |
|------|------------------------|
| **Product / binary** | `grok-cli` (`APP_NAME`) |
| **Implementation** | `src/grok-cli` (`path_add_*`, `path_ensure_profile`, `path_rc_test`, `inst_ensure_companion`, `inst_self_uninstall_cleanup_path`) |
| **USER_BIN** | `${HOME}/.local/bin` |
| **Exact PATH line** | `export PATH="<USER_BIN>:$PATH"` |
| **Installer comment** | `# Added by grok-cli installer (<VERSION>)` |
| **Profile sample** | `# BEGIN grok-cli profile source-bashrc` … source `${HOME}/.bashrc` … `# END grok-cli profile source-bashrc` |
| **Companion call site** | `inst_ensure_companion` on user-bin `install` / channel place / already-installed skip / `self-update` |
| **Privilege** | Type 0 this-login only |
| **Vendor grok block** | `# >>> grok installer >>>` for `~/.grok/bin` — **not** this PATH line (`requirement-grok-setup`) |

#### Sibling-unify table (this host family)

| Shared token | Value |
|--------------|--------|
| PATH identity | `export PATH="${HOME}/.local/bin:$PATH"` (Fish: `set -gx PATH ${HOME}/.local/bin $PATH`) |
| This product’s sticker | `# Added by grok-cli installer ({{VERSION}})` |
| Other stickers | `# Added by <APP_NAME> installer …` (sshd-cli, sudoer-cli, dns-cli, nginx-cli, …) — do not rewrite |
| Profile | Create-if-absent source-bashrc; never overwrite; do not delete on uninstall. First writer’s `# BEGIN <APP_NAME> profile source-bashrc` stays |
| Login-hook | Unused here; do not plant; do not strip `# BEGIN <app> login hook` … `# END` |
| Vendor grok block | `# >>> grok installer >>>` … `# <<< grok installer <<<` — other REQ; not this PATH line |
| Proof | Fixture `--root`; real `{{HOME}}/.bashrc` untouched |

This chat **MUST NOT** edit those other project trees. Unify means grok-cli **behaves** as a good sibling.

#### Foreign-edit / heal

| What the other app did | grok-cli MUST | grok-cli MUST NOT |
|------------------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Sibling already wrote the exact PATH + its comment | No second `export PATH=`; **MAY** add only grok-cli’s comment | Rewrite their comment |
| Sibling created `.profile` | Leave the body | Replace with grok-cli BEGIN/END |
| Login-hook markers in `.bashrc` | Keep the block; append PATH if missing | Strip `BEGIN`/`END` |
| Sibling deleted the exact PATH line | Append it once on next ensure | Restore a canned full `.bashrc` |
| Vendor grok installer block present | Untouched by USER_BIN ensure **and** by uninstall | Treat it as the shared `USER_BIN` line |

#### Compliance notes (implementation status)

| Rule | Status |
|------|--------|
| Bash `BASHRC` create / exact-line append / VERSION+PATH no-op (**TP-LC-20..22**) | **Implemented** |
| Profile create-if-absent; never overwrite (**TP-LC-12** / **TP-LC-14**) | **Implemented** |
| Heal on every user-bin ensure including already-installed skip | **Implemented** |
| Empty-dir uninstall keeps shared PATH while `USER_BIN` has files | **Implemented** |
| Uninstall comment match **only** `grok-cli` (not `# Added by .* installer`) | **Implemented** |
| Exact-line match on zsh / Fish (not `USER_BIN` substring) | **Implemented** |
| Honor `BASHRC` / `ZSHRC` / `FISH_CONFIG` / `PROFILE` env | **Implemented** |
| Comment-only append when sibling already wrote the exact PATH | **Implemented** (MAY = do append the grok-cli sticker) |
| `rc-test` routed; help testers heading | **Implemented** |
| Login-hook | **Unused** (honest) |

### 2.9 Why This Requirement Exists (Direct CIAO Alignment)

- **CIAO Principle 1 – Caution** (https://github.com/cloudgen/ciao): Never replace an existing rc body; never strip a shared `USER_BIN` PATH while other tools remain.  
- **CIAO Principle 2 – Intentional** (https://github.com/cloudgen/ciao): File vs feature vs fixture named; PATH line vs this product’s comment named.  
- **CIAO Principle 3 – Anti-fragile** (https://github.com/cloudgen/ciao): Second install heals a missing PATH line; sibling comments stay.  
- **CIAO Principle 5 – Single Source of Output** (https://github.com/cloudgen/ciao): User-visible PATH tips via `out_*`; file appends are class-C printf exceptions (`requirement-shell-output-requirements`).  
- **CIAO Principle 10 – Least-Privilege User** (https://github.com/cloudgen/ciao): This-login rc only; no in-tool `sudo` to edit another home.  
- **CIAO Principle 16 – Interactive vs Non-Interactive** (https://github.com/cloudgen/ciao): `rc-test` and install companion **MUST NOT** hang under `--json` / pipes.  
- **CIAO Principle 4 (O) / Principle 20** (https://github.com/cloudgen/ciao): Exact-line identity, scoped uninstall, and fixture tests are Protection Zone — not “simplify to echo PATH into `.bashrc`.”

---

## 3. Design Principles (CIAO / CIAO-Lite)

- **Caution:** Assume another similar CLI will write the same files; assume `install` will be re-run.  
- **Intentional:** One exact PATH line; per-app comments; profile is the door note, not a second PATH file.  
- **Anti-fragile:** Heal on companion; no-op when already exact; keep sibling stickers.  
- **Over-protect:** Do not lock the file; do not police other writers; do not become the sibling that wipes the note.  
- **SSOT:** `path_*` bodies here; binary lifecycle on local/online/self-management; dispatcher on CLI-interface; vendor grok PATH on grok-setup.  
- **Respect old working logic:** Keep `path_add_*` as the family; surgical fixes for create-if-missing, exact-line, companion-on-skip, and APP_NAME-only uninstall.

---

## Under command line for normal user only

When the ship unit detects a **command line for normal user only** (Termux, Git Bash, Windows cmd, or the same class):

| MUST | MUST NOT |
|------|----------|
| Keep **normal user privilege** (Type 0) only | Implement or enable **admin privilege** (Type 1) or **dedicated system user privilege** (Type 2) |
| Write **this login’s** `BASHRC` / `USER_BIN` PATH | Rewrite another user’s rc; in-tool `sudo`; wrap `apt` |
| Termux: named `pkg` stays Type 0 (`requirement-shell-termux-coding`) | Recommend `sudo curl \| sh` so PATH ensure runs as root |
| Git Bash / Windows cmd: same privilege ceiling | Invoke Termux `pkg` because Git Bash or Windows cmd was detected |

**This requirement:** PATH / profile ensure stay Type 0 this-login file writes. Tests retarget `BASHRC` to a temp folder — they **MUST NOT** require `sudo` or the developer’s real home. Termux default PATH often has no `USER_BIN`; create-if-missing `.bashrc` is mandatory (**L-PATH-01**).

---

## 4. Protection Rule (Sacred)

**Future AI assistants or maintainers MUST NOT**:

1. Replace an existing `.bashrc` / `.zshrc` / Fish config / `.profile` body to “ensure PATH.”  
2. Append a second exact `export PATH="<USER_BIN>:$PATH"` or invent a private PATH dialect.  
3. Rewrite another product’s `# Added by … installer` comment.  
4. Strip the shared PATH line on uninstall while `USER_BIN` still contains files.  
5. Delete `.profile` on uninstall.  
6. Use `/# Added by .* installer/d` (wipes sibling stickers).  
7. Ignore a non-empty `BASHRC` env (always write `${HOME}/.bashrc` instead).  
8. Leave `BASHRC` missing when `install` can create it, or skip companion because the CLI binary is already placed.  
9. Plant a login-review hook in `.bashrc` or `.profile` (unused on this product), or strip another product’s hook markers.  
10. Lock `.bashrc` (`chattr`, flock, exclusive ownership of the whole file) as “sibling protection.”  
11. Prove PATH ensure by rewriting this login’s real `~/.bashrc`.  
12. Claim path-ensure without **TP-LC-20** / **TP-LC-21** / **TP-LC-22**, or without dual-mentioning Type 0 **`rc-test --root`**.  
13. Mix `rc-test` into operational help grouping, or treat `rc-test` as install.  
14. Strip the vendor `# >>> grok installer >>>` block, or tell the operator to add `USER_BIN` when peer grok lives under `~/.grok/bin`.  
15. Strip the **Under command line for normal user only** section, or wrap `sudo` / `apt` to write rc.  
16. Edit sshd-cli / sudoer-cli / dns-cli (or any other project tree) from a grok-cli session without this-turn named root.

**Violating this rule is a critical shell-rc regression.**

---

## 5. Definition of done (path and shell support)

Work claiming PATH / login-rc support for grok-cli is **not done** if any of the following fail:

1. User-bin `install` creates `BASHRC` if missing and appends the exact PATH line if absent.  
2. Existing rc body is kept.  
3. `.profile` is created only when absent; existing body is kept.  
4. Second install does not duplicate the exact PATH line; VERSION+exact-PATH is a no-op.  
5. Uninstall keeps the shared PATH line while `USER_BIN` has other files; does not delete `.profile`; matches **only** grok-cli comments.  
6. Already-installed skip (checkout `install` and channel ensure) still runs companion.  
7. **TP-LC-20** / **TP-LC-21** / **TP-LC-22** pass with `BASHRC` in a random temp folder; real `{{HOME}}/.bashrc` untouched. A HOME-isolated substring grep alone is **not** sufficient.  
8. `rc-test` is dual-mentioned here and on `requirement-shell-cli-interface` **and** routed.  
9. Implementation changes cite `requirement-shell-path-and-shell-support`.
