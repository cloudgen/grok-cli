**file**: docs/requirements/requirement-shell-idempotency.md  
**Status**: Active (Version 1.0.0)  
**Area**: shell  
**Key**: `requirement-shell-idempotency`  
**Philosophy**: CIAO **v2.10.2** / CIAO-Lite (Caution • Intentional • Anti-fragile • Over-engineered / Over-protect)

## 1. Purpose

This requirement is the **project Single Source of Truth** for **idempotency (re-run safety)** of state-changing operations in the grok-cli POSIX shell CLI.

**Informal formula:** for ensure-style operation *f* and system state *x*, **f(f(x)) ≈ f(x)** for the **desired outcome** (logs and timestamps may differ).

---

### 1.1 Human-facing

Running install or backup again must be safe: no second binary mess, auth snapshot overwrite is the intended backup.

| You | Another role | Not this |
|-----|--------------|----------|
| Re-run `install` / `backup` | Same `auth.*` names in `/var/grok-cli` are replaced | Silent overwrite of another login’s files |

**Includes:** re-run safety. **Excludes:** sudoers install.

| You do… | What it means | What you type |
|---------|---------------|---------------|
| Push auth again | Same basenames in `/var/grok-cli` are replaced | `grok-cli backup` |


## 2. Core Rules / Requirements (Mandatory)

### 2.1 What must be idempotent

Every **state-changing** shell operation that **ensures** a desired configuration **MUST**:

1. **Detect** whether the desired state already holds.  
2. **Skip or no-op** unsafe work when it does.  
3. **Succeed** when already achieved — **MUST NOT** fail solely because state “already exists.”  
4. **Avoid duplicates** (binary installs, PATH lines, identical archive slot collisions handled by numbering). PATH / profile **bodies** (exact `export PATH=` line, sibling unify, scoped uninstall) live on `requirement-shell-path-and-shell-support`; this file keeps the re-run matrix.  
5. **Leave the system consistent** on every run (including partial prior installs).  
6. **Communicate** clearly when already done in human mode; respect quiet/json via output SSOT.

### 2.2 What a second run must not do

| Forbidden when desired state already holds | Prefer |
|--------------------------------------------|--------|
| Fail solely because state exists | Success + “already installed / nothing to uninstall” |
| Create duplicate managed binaries | Existence check first |
| Overwrite a correct install without force | No-op unless force |
| Leave half-applied worse state | Atomic steps; cleanup temps; fail loud |

### 2.3 Force override

Force policy (`--force` / `FORCE=1`) **MAY** re-apply ensure steps that would otherwise no-op **only** when documented. Force **MUST NOT** silently skip integrity or path validation for domain deposit.

### 2.4 Implementation Notes — command matrix (this project)

| Command / path | Desired state | Re-run when already good | Force / special |
|----------------|---------------|--------------------------|-----------------|
| `install` | Managed binary present at privilege-correct path | Success no-op | `--force` replaces from running ship unit |
| `uninstall` | Managed binary absent | Success no-op | `--force` skips confirm |
| `where-is-me` / `version` / `about` / `help` | Read-only | Always safe | N/A |
| `print-sudoers` | Emit fragment text | Safe re-print (same content for same user/host defaults) | Does not install into `/etc` |
| `generate-sudoer-request` | Local verified JSON grant at dest path | Overwrite same dest (draft) | Does not write `/etc` or inbound |
| `submit-sudoer-request` | Queue a **new** JSON request (sibling allocates next `n`) | Each success is a new `request_id`; not a no-op | Does not write `/etc`; does not `mkdir` inbound; missing inbound fails closed |
| `backup` | New archive deposit for this run | **Not** “skip backup”; each run **SHOULD** create next `N` or fail if naming cannot progress | Must not overwrite existing archive without explicit force policy (default: **never overwrite** — allocate next `N`) |
| `add-crontab` | This login’s crontab contains the studied backup + sync-auth command lines | Success no-op; **MUST NOT** duplicate lines | Does not write `/etc`; other crontab lines kept |

### 2.5 Domain numbering idempotency

Archive names use `${SOURCE_FOLDER_NAME}-YYYYMMDD-N.tar.gz`. For the same calendar day and same source basename:

1. **MUST** scan destination (or staging policy) for existing `N` values.  
2. **MUST** choose the next free positive integer `N` (1, 2, 3, …).  
3. **MUST NOT** overwrite an existing archive file by default.

### 2.6 Why This Requirement Exists (CIAO)

- **Principle 1 – Caution**: Re-runs must not corrupt installs or archives.  
- **Principle 3 – Anti-fragile**: Safe to re-invoke.  
- **Principle 12 – Backup**: New archives do not clobber prior ones.

## Under command line for normal user only

When grok-cli runs on Termux, Git Bash, Windows cmd, or the same class (this login only — no root, no dedicated system account):

| MUST | MUST NOT |
|------|----------|
| Keep **normal user privilege** only | Enable **admin privilege** (`sudo`, write `/etc`) or a **dedicated system user** |
| Treat admin-privilege and dedicated-account work as **unused** | Wrap `apt` / `dnf` / `yum`; `useradd`; recommend `sudo curl \| sh` |
| Termux: `pkg` as this login stays ordinary-user work | Recommend `sudo curl \| sh` as the install path |
| Git Bash and Windows cmd: same ceiling | Invoke Termux `pkg` because those hosts were detected |

Detect: Termux — `uname` contains Android, or `PREFIX` / `TERMUX_VERSION` is set. Git Bash — `MSYSTEM` or `uname -s` is MINGW*/MSYS*. Windows cmd — `OS=Windows_NT` after excluding Git Bash, Cygwin, and WSL.

**This requirement:** re-run safety stays this login. Do not heal `/etc` on this class.

---

## 3. Design Principles (CIAO / CIAO-Lite)

- Detect → ensure → success-if-done for lifecycle.  
- Domain backup is **additive** (new N), not “ensure same file.”  
- Fail closed on permission and path errors (idempotency ≠ never error).

---

## 4. Protection Rule (Sacred)

**Future AI assistants, Grok, or maintainers MUST NOT**:

1. Make `install` fail when already installed (force off).  
2. Overwrite existing dated archives by default.  
3. Treat idempotency as permission to ignore validation failures.  
4. Remove atomic install/stage patterns for “speed.”

5. Strip the **Under command line for normal user only** section, or enable admin privilege / a dedicated system user on Termux / Git Bash / Windows cmd.  

**Violating this rule is a critical re-run safety regression.**

## 5. Acceptance criteria

| ID | Criterion |
|----|-----------|
| AC-1 | Second `install` without force is success no-op |
| AC-2 | Second `uninstall` when absent is success no-op |
| AC-3 | Second `backup` same day allocates next `N` without overwrite |
